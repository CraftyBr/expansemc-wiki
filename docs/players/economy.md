# Economy

Expanse's server shops are setup a little bit differently than any other server's shop.
Our server shop operates on a weekly rotation, with each week having a theme of items being sold.

## Everyday Items

This shop contains items that can always be sold, though at a much smaller payout.

## Week 1 - Builder's Market

This shop contains building blocks like stone, wood, sand, and glass.

## Week 2 - Farmer's Market

This shop contains farming items like wheat, carrots, apples, and potatoes.

## Week 3 - Blacksmith's Market

This shop contains metals like iron, gold, diamonds, and blaze rods.

## Week 4 - Explorer's Market

This shop contains items like phantom membranes, chorus, end crystals, and nether wart.
