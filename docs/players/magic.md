# Wands

Every player starts out with the Beginner wand, and can level their wand up through Novice, Apprentice, and Wizard.

## Leveling Wands

Wands are leveled by using them. Every time you cast a spell, you are rewarded with __spell points__, though each spell has its own ten to fifteen minute cooldown, to encourage you to use every spell in your arsenal.

__Spell points__ are then used by right clicking an enchantment table with your wand, and buying new spells with them.

# Spells

Spells are activated by right or left clicking your wand.
