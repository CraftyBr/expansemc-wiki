# McMMO

McMMO is an RPG plugin that adds skills into Minecraft. These skills can be leveled up in several different ways, and all have different abilities unlocked at different levels.

To get started, do `/mcmmo`, or any of the skill names, e.g `/acrobatics`. To view the leaderboards for each skill as well as total power, do `/mctop`.
