# Axes

With the Axes skill you can use your axe for much more then just deforesting! You can hack and chop away at mobs with the effect of knockback and inflicting DEADLY criticals on mobs and players. Your Axe also becomes a hand-held woodchipper, breaking down the enemy's armor with ease as your level increases. Experience is gained by dealing damage to mobs, entities and players.

## Super Ability: Skull Splitter

While holding an Axe, the 'use' action (right-click by default) will activate the Super Ability Skull Splitter!

Skull Splitter adds an Area of Effect (AoE) to attacks with axes, dealing damage to nearby enemies whenever a target is hit. While using Skull Splitter, less damage is dealt to the primary target and an AoE effect is added to all attacks for the duration. This makes it great for crowds of enemies, but less effective when fighting one target!

The ability lasts for a duration based on the Axes skill level.
