# Salvage

Salvage is a child skill that allows you to get materials from tools/armor you salvage with it. This is a child skill of Repair and Fishing, averaging the two levels together.

## Abilities

### Advanced Salvage

Unlocks at Salvage level 35 by default When unlocked, this ability allows you to salvage damaged items. The yield percentage increases as you level up. A higher yield means that you can get more materials back. With advanced salvage you will always get 1 material back, unless the item is too damaged. So you don't have to worry about destroying items without getting anything in return. To illustrate how this works, here's an example: Let's say we salvage a gold pickaxe which is damaged for 20%, this means that the maximum amount you could get is only 2 (because the pick is crafted with 3 ingots - each worth 33,33% durability) which is equal to 66%. If your yield percentage is below 66% you are not able to get 2 ingots. If it is above this value you are able to gain the "full amount", which means that you will get 2 ingots.

### Arcane Salvaging

Unlocks at Salvage level 2 by default This ability allows you to get enchanted books when salvaging enchanted items. Depending on your level the chance of successfully extracting a full or partial enchantment varies. When an enchantment is partially extracted, the enchantment book will have a lower level enchantment compared to what it was on the item.
