# Archery

Archery is a skill focused around dealing damage to mobs and players using a bow and arrows. Experience is gained by dealing damage with a bow and arrows based on how far they are from their target.

## Abilities

### Skill Shot

As a player continues to increase their skills in Archery, their arrows hit their mark more often and with greater force.

Skill Shot is the player's ability to deal increased damage to enemies with their bow and arrows. Gaining additional levels in Archery increases the chance to hit and the damage of the Skill Shot passive ability.

### Daze

With a well placed shot, even the most steadfast opponent will falter.

Daze is an effect that can trigger on some of the player's shots, causing their enemy to feel nauseated. Gaining additional levels in Archery increases the chance to daze their opponent. This effect does not work on mobs.

### Retrieve

Even the most skilled Archer is nothing without their arrows.

Retrieve is an archer's ability to shoot without breaking their arrows. Gaining additional levels in Archery increases their chance to recover the arrows that they fired.
