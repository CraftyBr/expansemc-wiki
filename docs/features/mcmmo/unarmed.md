# Unarmed

Unarmed is a combat skill which allows players to use their fists as if they were a proper weapon. Experience in Unarmed is gained by dealing damage with your fists to mobs, or players. The experience gained is based on how much damage you deal to a mob, or player. In addition to this, each mob has its own experience multiplier.

## Super Ability: Berserk

The Berserk ability is activated by right clicking with no items equipped, whilst you have a block or mob 'selected' in your crosshairs and then left clicking. Clicking when your crosshairs are aimed at something yet not selected (e.g., a faraway block) will not trigger the ability, nor ready the ability.

When activated, Berserk has a few benefits. Firstly, if you left click on stone bricks they will change into cracked stone bricks. Secondly, blocks with no blast resistance (leaves, grass blocks, dirt, etc.) will break much faster with your bare hands. Thirdly, you receive a +50% damage boost on top of your current level's damage boost.

The duration of Berserk increases by 1 second every 50 (5 normal) levels, and starts at 2 seconds at level 1.
